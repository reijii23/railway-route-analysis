# 🚆 Railway Route Analysis

A government funded project, aimed at optimizing the railway transportation system in Indonesia using data-driven insights.
This project explores and delivers actionable insights for further use in improving the railway transportation system.
---

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze, visualize, and generate actionable insights for general information as well as data-driven improvements later on in the future.  
Originally inspired by real-world transportation systems, it utilizes **graph theory**, **data visualization**, and **performance-optimized querying** (e.g., Neo4j) to track train traversal on a graph database and detect potential bottlenecks.

---

## 💡 Features
- Efficient **route searching** across hundreds of stations 
- **Graph-based modeling** of train networks (using Neo4j)  
- **Performance optimization** for long routes  
- Integration with **JavaScript** for data analysis and visualization
  
---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Cypher Query Language  
- **Database:** Neo4j (Graph Database)  
- **Visualization:** react-force-graph  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Provide actionable insights for further improvements to the railway transportation system  
- Locate potential bottlenecks and congestions during rush hour  
- Visualize route networks and travel paths interactively
- Provide information for future commuters and government bodies for their respective uses
- Visualize concise data and insights 

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Import train network data (stations, routes, and travel times).  
2. Transform the data into a graph database (Neo4j) for better data management and node traversal.
3. Analyze graph network and generate generate various actionable insights.  
4. Visualize stored graph for users to get a better image of how the network looks like.  
5. Provide interactive visualizations and result displays for any and all possible uses.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Build a more user-friendly dashboard
- Experiment with route prediction using ML models  
- Improve visualization and interactivity
