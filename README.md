# 🚆 Railway Route Analysis

This project was developed as part of a government-funded research collaboration aimed at improving Indonesia’s national railway system. By leveraging graph databases, the project visualizes the railway network as a graph, making node traversals more defined and easier to track. It delivers actionable insights through in-depth analyses powered by streamlined, cost-efficient queries that can quickly run specific analyses at the user’s request. Additionally, the system generates interactive graph visualizations to provide a clearer picture of how the network is interconnected, offering data-backed insights to support future transportation planning.

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes railway route data to uncover operational inefficiencies and support data-driven improvements.  
It uses **graph theory**, **data visualization**, and **performance-optimized querying** (via Neo4j) to simulate train traversal and detect potential congestion across the network.

---

## 💡 Features
- Efficient **route searching** across hundreds of stations 
- **Graph-based modeling** of train networks (using Neo4j)  
- **Performance optimization** for long routes  
- Integration with **JavaScript** for data analysis and visualization

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Provide actionable insights for further improvements to the railway transportation system  
- Locate potential bottlenecks and congestions during rush hour  
- Visualize route networks and travel paths interactively
- Provide information for future commuters and government bodies for their respective uses
- Visualize concise data and insights

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Import train network data (stations, routes, and travel times).  
2. Transform the data into a graph database (Neo4j) for better data management and node traversal.
3. Analyze graph network and generate generate various actionable insights.  
4. Visualize stored graph for users to get a better image of how the network looks like.  
5. Provide interactive visualizations and result displays for any and all possible uses.
